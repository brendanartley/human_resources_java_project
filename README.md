# human_resources_java_project

This project was made in Eclipse IDE and was a Maven Project with maven dependancies.

I created a GUI which acts like a job application form. When the applicant fills out all of their information and hits the submit button, they are promepted to confirm their application, and it is then submitted. They receive a thank you email, and their application information is send to what would be a HR monitored email address.

Important: 

1. Check each java file and comments on top of code for edits needed to make this run on your computer

2. I built this application in eclipse with JDK 1.5, if you plan to build the maven project you will have to specify which JDK version you are running in the properties tag in pom.xml
