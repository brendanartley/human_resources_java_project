# human_resources_java_project

This project was made in Eclipse IDE and was a Maven Project with maven dependancies.

I created a GUI which acts like a job application form. When the applicant fills out all of their information and hits the submit button, their application is completed. They receive a thank you email, and their application information is send to what would be a HR monitored email database.

I would like to go a step further with this project and use some sort of AI model to look at their response to the short answer questions and provide a "grade". Im not sure if I can utilize a model that has been trained using a different language (python), or how I would acquire such data, but this could be a path I go down in the future.

Do make sure to properly format location of the image_icon in your folder when you build this yourself. More info in code comments.
