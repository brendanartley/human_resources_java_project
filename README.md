# human_resources_java_project

This project was made in Eclipse IDE and was a Maven Project with maven dependancies.

I created a GUI which acts like a job application form. When the applicant fills out all of their information and hits the submit button, they are promepted to confirm their application, and it is then submitted. They receive a thank you email, and their application information is send to what would be a HR monitored email address.

Important: 

a. Do make sure to properly format location of the image_icon in your folder when you build this yourself so you can see the icon on the welcome frame.

b. make sure to enter your email address and password you want being the HR file. Check java files and comments on top of code for more info.

c. I built this application in eclipse with JDK 1.5, if you plan to build the maven project you will have to specify which version you are running in the properties tag in pom.xml
